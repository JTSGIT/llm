# LLM Project

## Project Task
The chosen project task is Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews. The goal is to develop a model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. It is divided into training (25,000 reviews) and test (25,000 reviews) splits.

## Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained model selected for this project is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), known for its effectiveness in understanding the context of text for sentiment analysis.

## Performance Metrics
The performance of the model will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters to be optimized include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and dropout rate.
